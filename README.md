The [Dododex Taming Calculator for Ark: Survival Evolved](http://www.dododex.com) is being translated into every language and your help is needed!

![Translate Dododex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dododex/translations/master/translate.png?2)

Dododex is being translated to 39+ languages. The translation will begin on Github and then be added to the app soon. After going live, continued maintence and new languages will be added through Github.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

### 1. Open [translations.js](translations.js) and click "Edit."
### 2. Add translations
Look at the English version of a phrase, and then add a translation to the corresponding section for your language (language codes are listed below). It's best to translate from English to your language, as other languages may not yet be verified.

Special (non-Latin) characters such as ä or 渡 can be inserted into the file directly without translating them to HTML entities (don't use `&auml;` or `&#x6E21;`).

If you are unsure of any translation, please do not add it. Do not add notes to your translation, or add multiple translations. Instead, open an Issue (detailed below) to discuss the correct translation.

### 3. Submit your changes
This will be submitted as a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) and will be approved.

(If you have any trouble with these instructions, but still want to help, please contact me at dan14lev at gmail.com!)

## NOTES

### Starting A Discussion
If you're unsure of any translations, have questions about a phrase or its context, or think that a translation is incorrect, start a discussion by [creating an issue](https://github.com/dododex/translations/issues/new). Please include the language in the title of the issue.

### Variables
Some phrases have variables in them where a term will be inserted into the sentence. These are indicated with a `{{x}}`. For example, `There are {{x}} creatures` could become `There are 50 creatures` and the number would increment as more creatures are added. All translations must include this variable — be sure to place the variable in the correct place in the phrase.

### Adding A Missing Language
To add a new language: 

1. Copy and paste the entire English section ("en")
2. Change the "en" to your language's code (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/tomihasa/google-language-codes\">list of language codes</a>)
3. Translate each of the phrases.
